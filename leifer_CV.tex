%\section{Research Interests}
%\noindent My research focuses on precision measurements in biology using tractable model systems. At all levels, biological organisms exhibit collective phenomena, where large-scale behaviors arise from the action of local players. Members of my lab study the emergence of cellular- and population-level order in prokaryotes by probing the coordinated action of thousands of individual proteins inside a cell and by measuring the dynamics of hundreds of cells simultaneously within a population. Another aspect of our work takes a data-driven approach to studying animal behavior in order to discover deep connections between genetics, neurocircuitry and behavior.
%\noindent My research focuses on developing new, precision imaging and image analysis techniques to study the emergence of large-scale movements from the collective action of individual molecules. By combining new methods for physically probing cells and unique experimental pipelines, I have developed a deep understanding of how cells grow into the correct size and shape, and how cells glide to form large-scale population structure.  %More recently, I have embarked on a major effort to quantify animal movements using statistical techniques.
